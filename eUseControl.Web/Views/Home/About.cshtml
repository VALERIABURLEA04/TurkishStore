                        Our Story
                    </h3>

                    <p class="stext-113 cl6 p-b-26">
                        In the heart of Chişinău, two childhood friends dreamt of blending local craftsmanship with modern style. What began in a tiny workshop above a bakery in 2015 soon blossomed into a community hub, where seamstresses, leatherworkers, and designers pooled their talents to create pieces that spoke of Moldova’s rich heritage. Each autumn, as the leaves turned gold in the city parks, our founders hosted open-air markets on Stefan cel Mare Boulevard, inviting passers-by to discover handcrafted jackets, scarves, and artisan accessories made from locally sourced wool and leather.

                        By 2018, word had spread beyond the capital: visitors from small villages and neighboring Romania began placing custom orders. Encouraged by this response, we opened our first flagship store on Pushkin Street—a bright, sunlit space lined with reclaimed wood shelves and leafy potted plants, where every garment, bag, and shoe tells a story of dedication and skill. Today, we remain true to that original vision: supporting independent artisans, investing in sustainable materials, and celebrating the creativity that pulse through Chişinău’s streets.

We’re proud to be part of Chişinău’s reviving artisan movement—and can’t wait to share the next chapter of our story with you.

                        Our Mission
                    </h3>

                    <p class="stext-113 cl6 p-b-26">
                        We believe true style starts with respect—respect for people and the planet. Our mission is to nurture Chişinău’s creative community by providing fair wages, zero-waste workshops, and mentorship programs for emerging artisans. Every collection we launch reflects seasonal cycles, from flax-green spring linen dresses to hand-woven wool coats for winter’s chill. By championing transparency at every step—from farm to finishing stitch—we aim to inspire others to choose quality over quick fashion.
                    </p>

                    <p class="stext-113 cl6 p-b-26">
                        Beyond clothing, we’re committed to giving back: a portion of each sale supports local educational initiatives in rural Moldova, helping young students learn design and textile skills. Together with our partners, we host annual “Design for Change” hackathons, where teams reimagine traditional motifs for tomorrow’s wardrobe. It’s more than a brand—it’s a movement to preserve craft, empower voices, and weave a brighter future for everyone in our city and beyond.
